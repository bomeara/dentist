Description: This will sample points around a specified distance
    from the maximum likelihood estimates. This should be a better way to
    estimate uncertainty than using the Hessian of the likelihood
    equation. It works by "denting" the likelihood surface to make a ridge
    at the desired difference in log likelihood and then "walks" around this dented surface,
    sampling points.
